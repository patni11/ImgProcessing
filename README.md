# Photoshop Lite (Java)
This was my university project. I pushed it later to github because I was not allowed to make my code public while I was in the class.

To run the code, make sure you have java installed. 
Then download the repo and run

'''
java -jar imageProcessing.jar
'''

It should work :)
